# 3dChess
To run run the 3dchess executable.
To edit, open this project in Unity 6 via Unity Hub

Movement is WASD and hold right click to rotate camers. 
You can left click a chess piece to see possible movement options (green tiles)
    You can then left click a green tile to move the piece there
    Clicking a non-green tile resets the piece, click on a piece again to see green tiles
The turns go in order white -> black -> white etc
Clicking on a black tile during white's turn does nothing and vice versa


Currently, there are some know issues:
Pawn does not move properly and has no Promotion
King's movement is incomplete (sort of)
No checkmate or check system
No win condition
No multiplayer
No Ai Bot
